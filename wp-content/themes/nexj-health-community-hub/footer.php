							<p>NexJ Health Inc. is a provider of participant-facing population health management
		 solutions that deliver participant engagement for chronic disease management. At NexJ
		 Health, we believe that the most efficient and cost-effective way to offset the rise in
		chronic disease is to empower participants, with the support of their families, friends,
		 and healthcare professionals, to actively participate in managing their own chronic
		 condition(s). By engaging participants through NexJ Connected Wellness, participants
		 are more likely to achieve their health goals, payers can lower costs, providers can
		 improve care to participants, and pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies can
		 improve medication adherence.</p>
